          bio: `Dr. Niraj Govinda Shrestha is the Chairman and Founder of Sumedha Air, a visionary initiative aimed at transforming Nepal’s aviation sector. With a mission to lead and modernize helicopter services in the country, Dr. Shrestha brings his decades-long experience in industrial manufacturing, infrastructure, banking, and international trade to the skies.
          <br><br>
          A dynamic and results-driven business leader, Dr. Shrestha has consistently demonstrated a capacity to unite technical expertise with high-level strategic investment. With a strong foundation in civil and irrigation engineering, his career spans continents—merging engineering knowledge with entrepreneurial vision to drive impactful growth across multiple sectors. Today, through Sumedha Air, he is committed to elevating Nepal’s aviation capabilities, expanding access to remote areas, and setting new standards for operational excellence, safety, and innovation.
          <br><br>
          Educated in the former Soviet Union, he holds a PhD in Irrigation Systems and a Master’s degree in Civil Engineering, specializing in bridge and tunnel construction. His early training at Pulchowk Engineering Campus and schooling in Tansen, Palpa, laid the groundwork for a lifelong commitment to national development. Over the years, he has played a transformative role in several industrial collaborations, particularly with Belarusian heavy machinery manufacturers such as Amkodor and Elizer, helping introduce advanced agricultural and construction technology to South Asia. In the banking and finance sector, he is a founding promoter and shareholder of Sanima Bank and Sanima Hydro, contributing significantly to Nepal’s financial modernization and energy independence. His international business ventures are equally wide-ranging. As Chairman of Buddha Lumbini Group in Spain and owner of Evita Pvt. Ltd. in Nepal, he has helped build bridges between Nepal and global markets. He has been instrumental in the development of institutions like Medicare Hospital and Kantipur Television, combining healthcare and media impact with economic foresight.
          <br><br>
          Through his company Vostok International Pvt. Ltd., he continues to coordinate international trade and investment, focusing on sectors that support Nepal’s long-term sustainability and competitiveness. In recent years, his leadership has expanded into Nepal’s growing aviation sector. Recognizing the strategic importance of helicopters for rescue, tourism, remote connectivity, and logistics, he has been actively involved in laying the groundwork for a new era of aviation services in Nepal. Through direct partnerships with international aviation institutions and manufacturers, he is helping bring world-class standards and operational capabilities to the country.
          <br><br>
          His goal is to not only support safe and efficient helicopter services, but also to make Nepal a regional hub for high-altitude aviation excellence.
